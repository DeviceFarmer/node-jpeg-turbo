# node-jpeg-turbo

**node-jpeg-turbo** provides minimal [libjpeg-turbo](http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/) bindings for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). It is very, very fast compared to other alternatives, such as [node-imagemagick-native](https://github.com/mash/node-imagemagick-native) or [jpeg-js](https://github.com/eugeneware/jpeg-js).

Currently the focus is on decompressing images as quickly as possible.

## Requirements

We use [NAN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) to guarantee maximum v8 API compatibility, so in theory any [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/) version should work fine, as long as the [libjpeg-turbo](http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/) libraries and headers are installed.

Here's how to install the libraries:

**On OS X**

```bash
brew install jpeg-turbo
```

**On Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04**

```bash
apt-get install libjpeg-turbo8-dev
```

**On Debian**

```bash
apt-get install libturbojpeg1-dev
```

**Others**

Search your package manager for `libjpeg-turbo`, `turbojpeg` or similar. Make sure to install the `-dev` package if available.

## Installation

Make sure you've got the [requirements](#requirements) installed. Then simply install from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install --save jpeg-turbo
```
